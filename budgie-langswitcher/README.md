# Language Switcher Applet

Language Switcher is an applet to use a different input source (language) per application. Simply set a default language to be used. Subsequently, simply set a different language, with the application's window in front, and an exception for that specific application is remembered.

Exceptions can be removed at any time, either from the applet's menu or by setting the application's language, again, with its window in front.
