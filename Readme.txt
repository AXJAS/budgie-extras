About Window Mover
------------------
Window Mover is an easy way to move windows across workspaces. If a window is dragged to the bottom of the screen, a bar appears, aloowing the user to send the dragged window to any of the workspaces.

A "secret" command to run from a shortcut key, applying the mover on the currently active window:
/opt/wmover/wmover/wmover_run -single

- Window Mover depends on both wmctrl and xdotool -
