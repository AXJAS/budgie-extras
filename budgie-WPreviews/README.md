Budgie WindowPreviews is an application (applet) to show an overview of windows in an expose- like way. After the applet is added to the panel, two commands can be run from shortcuts. 1] to show an overview of all windows on the current workspace: /opt/budgie-extras/wprviews/code/wprviews_window. 2] to show an overview of windows of the currently active window: /opt/budgie-extras/wprviews/code/wprviews_window current.
