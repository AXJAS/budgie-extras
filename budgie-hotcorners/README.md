#Budgie HotCorners

(applet) adds hot corner functionality to the desktop. Enable the hot corner by clicking the toggle button and subsequently add the command to the entry. 
Hot corners can be enabled and disabled on the fly from the applet's menu, and are applied immediately. If none of the corners is set, the background script automatically stops running and vice versa
