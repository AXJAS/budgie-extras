Budgie HotCorners is an application (applet) to add hot corner functionality to the desktop. Enable the hot corner by pressing the toggle button and subsequently add the command to the entry. Hot corners can be enabled and disabled on the fly from the menu, and are applied immediately. If none of the corners is set, the background script automatically stops running.
